Lowercase jquery is used because AMD module names are\r\n// derived from file names, and jQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase\r\n// file name. Do this after creating the global so that if an AMD module wants\r\n// to call noConflict to hide this version of jQuery, it will work.\r\n\r\n// Note that for maximum portability, libraries that are not jQuery should\r\n// declare themselves as anonymous modules, and avoid setting a global if an\r\n// AMD loader is present. jQuery is a special case.
